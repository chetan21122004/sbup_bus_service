 SBUP Bus Live Tracker App – Prompt
📌 Overview:
This app is designed for SBUP students to track the live location of their assigned buses across 5 fixed routes and 3 shift timings (Shift I, II, III). The app aims to replicate a metro-style live tracking where students can see the real-time progress of the bus on their route, depicted through an intuitive linear stop-to-stop visualization (circle/line UI).

🎯 Key Features:
1. 👤 Student Login
Students can securely log in using their college ID/email.

Upon login, students can:

Select their route and shift.

View live bus location on that route.

Mention how many people are at a specific stop (for bus load estimation).

2. 🗺️ Live Location Tracking
Each bus driver broadcasts their real-time location.

Students can track the bus movement visually, similar to how a metro system shows active stations (highlighted circles as the bus progresses).

Each route includes named stops, visualized in order.

3. 🛑 Metro-style Stop View
Each route will show a horizontal or vertical path with circular stop indicators.

The current bus location is shown as an animated marker moving between circles (stops).

Stops will be labeled (e.g., Katraj Chowk, Hinjawadi, etc.).

4. 📅 Shift-based Schedules
The app will support 3 shifts:

Shift I: 08.00 am (Departure at 12.45 PM)

Shift II: 10.00 am (Departure at 03.45 PM)

Shift III: 12.15 pm (Departure at 05.30 PM)

Each shift has dedicated buses with defined start and end times.

5. 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Stop-wise Student Count
Students can tap on their stop and mention how many students are waiting there.

This helps bus admins and drivers estimate load and occupancy in real time.

6. 🚍 Driver Assignment Display
Each route and shift displays assigned driver name and contact number.

Helps in contacting the driver in emergencies or confusion.

7. 📋 Route Information Panel
Each route has:
